## About

This app interfaces between the Arduino board and ThorImages software to control odor delivery to mice during *in vivo* imaging experiments.

## Getting started

1. Make sure ThorImages is open and running.
2. Open "Odor Delivery App.exe" on the Desktop, and you should see this screen:

2. Click on "Open Directory" and select the folder where your acquired ThorImages will be saved to. It should be named correctly in the format YYMMDD--123456-7-8_ROIX, where 123456-7-8 is the animal ID, and X is the ROI number.
